## What I learned - HW 5

Even though the tutorial videos were pretty short and simple to follow, I still learned a lot.

First, it was very helpful to have further practice/exposure to the encapsulation pattern we used in HW 3. I liked how everything was divided into clear sections: variable declarations, private method declarations, private methods, and the public API. It's important to keep code organized and readable for future maintenance.

Second, I learned more about JavaScript functions. I've used JavaScript a fair amount, but I'm usually on my own and not writing the best code. I liked seeing how callbacks can be passed around, how you can pull JSON data from a server without using jQuery, and combining it all with data storage and manipulation. It wasn't difficult, but was really good for me to brush up on the fundamentals.

Third, I learned more about Chrome Developer Tools and debugging. I've never set breakpoints in Chrome, so that was important to learn. I also liked hearing about the Cache Killer Chrome extension and I'm sure I'll use that a lot this semester.
